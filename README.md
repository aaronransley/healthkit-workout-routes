# healthkit-workout-routes

> Provide an Apple HealthKit XML export and the magic within will help you parse out GPS routes, spin up a small Vue.js + Nuxt.js application, and serve up your routes plotted on HTML5 canvas elements. Have fun!

## Privacy

None of the included code will _ever_ upload your HealthKit or GPS data to any location. **Please open an issue on GitHub** if you feel that some element of this project may compromise a users security!

## Requirements

* Node 8.x LTS
* `yarn` (you can install `yarn` with: `npm i -g yarn`)

## Setup

* run `yarn install`
* import HealthKit data â€” see below
* run `yarn process` to pull HealthKit data apart and generate the JSON needed by Nuxt.js application
* run `yarn dev` & open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Importing HealthKit data

    3. Select the portrait icon in the top right
    4. Press Export Health Data, and confirm the export.
       * It may take some time to export.
